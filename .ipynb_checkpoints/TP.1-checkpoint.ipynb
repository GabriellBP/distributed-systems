    "## Entrega\n",
    "\n",
    "As respostas deverão ser entregues nos devidos campos desse arquivo, ou seja, em [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) e no formato [IJulia Notebook](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "O programa deve ser implementado na linguagem de programação **Julia**. Seu trabalho será testado na [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com), portanto teste seu arquivo IJulia na JulizBox antes de enviá-lo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forma \n",
    "\n",
    "O arquivo IJulia Notebook deverá ser entregue ao Professor **exclusivamente através do Google Classroom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A responsabilidade sobre a integridade do arquivo contendo trabalho é exclusivamente dos discentes. Serão ignorados os trabalhos cujos arquivos não conseguirem ser abertos pelo Professor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prazos\n",
    "\n",
    "O prazo de entrega sem atraso é o dia **18/11/17**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trabalhos entregues com atraso serão aceitos, no máximo, até o o dia **19/11/17**. Serão descontados 5% da nota obtida por dia de atraso.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pontuação extra\n",
    "\n",
    "O(a) discente que realizar mais tarefas, além do que foi especificado neste trabalho, o professor atribuirá de 0,5 a 1,0 ponto extra a depender da relevância da contribuição no programa. O critério será decidido pelo professor. \n",
    "\n",
    "O(a) discente deve indicar qual é a tarefa executada. Por exemplo, adição de funcionalidades, armazenamento de dados em arquivo, documentação de código, comentários em inglês sem erros ortográficos, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plágio** A nota zero será atribuída caso haja qualquer tipo de cópia parcial ou integral assim como as devidas medidas legais. Leia a [cartilha sobre plágio](http://www.noticias.uff.br/arquivos/cartilha-sobre-plagio-academico.pdf).\n",
